## About

`idc-index` is a Python package that enables query of the basic metadata and
download of DICOM files hosted by the
[NCI Imaging Data Commons (IDC)](https://imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov).

ðŸ‘· ðŸš§ This package is in its early development stages. Its functionality and API
will change. Stay tuned for the updates and documentation, and please share your
feedback about it by opening issues in this repository, or by starting a
discussion in [IDC User forum](https://discourse.canceridc.dev/).ðŸš§

## Usage

There are no prerequisites - just install the package ...

```bash
$ pip install idc-index
```

... and download files corresponding to any collection, DICOM
PatientID/Study/Series as follows:

```python
from idc_index import index

client = index.IDCClient()

all_collection_ids = client.get_collections()

client.download_from_selection(collection_id="rider_pilot", downloadDir="/some/dir")
```

... or run queries against the "mini" index of Imaging Data Commons data!

```python
from idc_index import index

client = index.IDCClient()

query = """
SELECT
  collection_id,
  STRING_AGG(DISTINCT(Modality)) as modalities,
  STRING_AGG(DISTINCT(BodyPartExamined)) as body_parts
FROM
  index
GROUP BY
  collection_id
ORDER BY
  collection_id ASC
"""

client.sql_query(query)
```

Details of the attributes included in the index are in the release notes.

## Tutorial

This package was first presented at the 2023 Annual meeting of Radiological
Society of North America (RSNA) Deep Learning Lab
[IDC session](https://github.com/RSNA/AI-Deep-Learning-Lab-2023/tree/main/sessions/idc).

Please check out
[this tutorial notebook](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/IDC-Tutorials/blob/master/notebooks/labs/idc_rsna2023.ipynb)
for the introduction into using `idc-index` for navigating IDC data.

- [s5cmd](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd) is a highly efficient, open source,
  multi-platform S3 client that we use for downloading IDC data, which is hosted
  in public AWS and GCS buckets
- [SlicerIDCBrowser](https://github.com/ImagingDataCommons/SlicerIDCBrowser) 3D
  Slicer extension that relies on `idc-index` for search and download of IDC
  data
